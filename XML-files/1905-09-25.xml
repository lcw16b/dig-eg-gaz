					<p>Bubonic Plague.—Only one fresh case of plague occurred in Egypt throughout
						last week, namely at Alexandria, and all other places are declared free.
						Three Europeans recovered during this period and there were two deaths, and
						one fresh case, an Italian grocer of the Menshieh district was notified
						yesterday. There are now only two cases under treatment. The total number of
						cases from January 1 to date amounts to 258, as compared with 804 daring the

					<p>The Great Earthquake in Calabria — The disastrous earthquake which occurred
						in the early morning of the 8th inst. at Catanzaro Calabria, South Italy,
						was clearly recorded by the Milne seismograph at the Helouan ob- servatory.
						The first small tremors occurred at 3h. 48 1/2 m. a.m. (Egyptian standard
						time) followed by two maxima at 4h. 1 1/2 m. and 4 h. 5 m. respectively. The
						two large waves produced an amplitude of 9 millimetres of movement of the
						seismograph pendulum and were followed by small tremors lasting till 5h.
						30m. As Egyptian time is one hour before Italian time and the shock in Italy
						was felt at 5 minutes to 8 a.m Italian time, the distur- bance appears to

					<head>NOTES FBOM PORT SAID. BLOWING UP OF THE CHATHAM. (Fbom our own
						Correspondent).</head>
					<p>Port Said, Satnrday. Confirming my wire of this morning I now send a few of
						tho more interesting details of this unfortunate affair.</p>
					<p>It will be remembered that on the 9th inst Lieutenant Cunningham R A. and Mr.
						Ringros of the citadel, Cairo, came down here specially to survey and advise
						the Canal Company on the best methods of dealing with the matter. Their
						advice, after lengthy discussion and after a consultation held at the scene
						of the wreck and at Port Said in the presence of Messrs. Reynaud,Smitt,and
						the chiefs of the engineers’ staff, was that it would be decidedly unsafe to
						handle the 91 tons of explosives in any way or to subject the vessel to any
						shocks ; this advice involved the prohibition of any salvage operations
						which entailed any system of pum- ping as highly dangerous ; the reason
						being that a large quantity of the dynamite (of which there were over 3,000
						cases on board) had by that time become saturated with water, (the holds
						being full) and had in consequence given out a considerable quantity of
						nitro-glycerin which, in its turn, had become part and parcel of the water
						which the holds contained. It was evident, then, that the shocks which
						pumping would give this mixture would in all probabi- lity cause an
						explosion and mean the loss of the lives of all in the vicinity. However, it
						would appear that no decision was at that time definitely taken though
						preparation was made for eventualities of all kinds. The fresh water canal
						was barred at several points, togs were held in readiness on the spot,
						special pilots were sent to assist the navigation, and the canal banks were
						as far as possible protec- ted. Navigation went on during daylight with few
						exceptions, captains of ships being com- pelled to sign a declaration which
						indicated the knowledge of the situation and the risk entailed by ships
						passing the spot. On Wednes day, Mr. Conllant (L’Agent Principals) Mr.
						Perrier (L’ingenienr en Chef) and one or two other gentlemen of the canal
						staff who were sent out specially, arrived here by the Isis from Brindisi,
						which vessel had on board Mr. H. Harris, the eminent metallurgical chemist
						of of Messrs. Nobel's factory, and two assistants, Messrs. Cunningham and
						Thompson.</p>
					<p>The vessel reached here early and by 9 a.m. the entire staff here, with those
						who had recently arrived, were on board the special launch which was to take
						them to the Chatham.</p>
					<p>Arriving on the scene the several members of the commission proceeded to the
						sunken vessel in boats. Mr. Harris had not been here many minutes, before he
						discovered bubbles of what appeared to be air rising from the holds, and he
						at once set about collecting the "air” in glass vessels. The glasses were
						carefully taken away from the vessel and experiments were made which proved
						beyond doubt that the "air” was nothing more nor less than hydrogen in an
						almost pure state. (Hydrogen, though as an element perfectly harmless,
						becomes highly explosive when mixed with oxygen in the pro- portion of 2 to
						1 by volume, owing to their great affinity. Ed. E.Q.) This apparently led
						the experts to the conclusion that acid was at work on the iron in the ship
						or her cargo, and the more the acid increases in quantity the more the
						danger of spontaneeous explosion, owing to the greater quantity of
						nitroglycerin being subjected to chemical action, for it would appear that
						this is a substance whose safety only lies in its absolute lack of acid,
						hence its vary frequent washings in preparation and manufacture.</p>
					<p>Deliberations were proceeded with on return t) Port Sald, and the advice of
						Mr. Harris was wired to Paris. Mr. Tillier arrived on Friday morning and the
						replies to the telegram would appear to have roached here the same morning,
						for after a further visit to the wreck, it was decided to prooeed with as
						little delay as possible to the explosion of the vesseL The day, Thursday
						next, was finally fixed last night, it being the day after the passage of
						the P. and 0. mail for India and Australia, and it has been since officially
						intimated that all traffic is to close on Wednesday evening in order to give
						the experts full time in which to test currents and lay charges as they
						require to be, most carefally. Troops have been asked for from Cairo who
						will form a cordon round the spot in a circle of some six miles diameter,
						this being apparently a safe distance from which the effect of this monster
						explosion may watched.</p>
					<p>In the opinion of tho expert committee unlikely the shock will be the of much
						damage in Port Said beyond perhaps a few broken windows for it must
						collected that there is over 25 feet of water above the explosives and that
						the canal banks will keep the lateral disturbance largely within bounds. It
						is not anticipated either that the railway will greatly suffer beyond
						displacement and loosening of rails, and should the fresh water canal be
						damaged, which is more than likely, it will, it is hoped, not greatly
						interfere with the water supply here, as the deviation of the channel to the
						extent of 220 yards is now completed, so that should the old canal be out
						up, which is pro- bable, the new channel is hardly likely to suffer
						appreciably. The ship canal’s east bank will undoubtedly be blown to atoms
						and the west bank too will probably be badly damaged, but the main trouble
						is considered by the experts here, who have the matter in hand, to be the
						effort of the tidal wave may attain practically any proportion, and will
						probably cause a great deal of da- <cb/>mage in this harbour unless craft
						are moored in the roadstead and well dear of each other.</p>
					<p>The difficulty in saying beforehand what will actually oocur on Thursday lies
						in the fact that no semblance even of a criterion exists in the history of
						explosives, and therefore, though it is probable that the experts have erred
						on the right side, their calculations are based on pure surmise. The meur-
						ers of the commission are Messrs. Tillier, Coullant, Schmitt, Reynaud and,
						Perrier, Doyer, Jusserand, Koenig, Harri', Cunningham, and Thompson.</p>
					<p>(From another Correspondent). Intense excitement has been evident in Port
						Said since the committee of experts finally decided to blow op the Chatham.
						There is, of course, much speculation as to what the effects of such an
						enormous explosion are likely to be, and some of the inhabitants anti-
						cipate the event with most ridiculous terror. The shock will, of of course,
						be felt in the town but there is very little danger of any serious damage
						being done as the sunken vessel is nineteen kilometres away. Meanwhile
						prepara- tions are being made for the blowing up of the vessel, and I learn
						on good authority that the batteries for the generation of the electric
						power have already been fixed at Kantars, which is some twenty-two
						kilometres from the position of the Chatham.</p>
					<p>The railway authorities anticipate the loos- ening of the rails, and have
						made arrange- ments for the work of relaying them to be started as soon as
						possible after the explosion, They have over a thousand bags of sand in
						readiness and as a large gang of workmen will work on the line without a
						pause traffic is not likely to be very seriously delayed.</p>
					<p>I do not know whether any steps are being taken for a temporary telegraph
						line to be laid sufficiently far from the scene of the explosion to be
						rendered safe from destruction, but as those which run along the railway are
						almost certain to be thrown down by the force of the explosion for a
						considerable distance it is to be hoped that provision is being made for the
						maintenance of telegraphs communication between here and the rest of Egypt,
						especially as the mails will be greatly delayed.</p>
					<p>It is difficult to ascertain exactly what weight of dynamite will be
						exploded. First reports gave the amount as 70 tons, which was said to be the
						amount which appeared in the manifest, and then came the story that there
						was at least 120 tons aboard. Probably 100 tons is an approximately accurate
						estimate,but after all the explosion will be so terrible that a few tons
						more or less will make but little difference.</p>

					<head>NAVAL NOTES.</head>
					<p>H.M.S. Sirius, contrary to expectations, did not receive orders at Suez to
						proceed to enquire into the Red Sea piracies ; she transitted the Canal
						shortly after her arrival at Suez and arrived here yesterday, leaving for
						Malta and home at noon to-day.</p>
					<p>Yesterday afternoon one of the hydrographic department (French) corvettes
						arrived in from sea acoompanied by the new armoured cruiser Dupetit Thouars,
						en route for the East. She was to have entered the Canal to-day, but owing
						to the large number of vessels coming from Suez is to remain here
						to-night.</p>
					<p>The Dupetit Thouarsisan armoured cruiser of comparatively recent type and
						great offensive power. Displacing 9,616 metric tons she is capable of a
						speed of 21 knots per hour at forced draught, and has a maximum radius of
						action of 10,000 miles at ten knots speed, While her armour protection is
						less thorough than that of the Japanese vessels of the Asama type, and the
						latest British, French, and German armoured cruiser, her armament is
						proportionately very powerful, comprising two in. q.f. in turrets, eight 6.4
						q.f. in casemates, r 3.9 in. q f. in shields, twenty-two small quick firers
						and two submerged torpedo tubes. was built at Toulon and was launched July
