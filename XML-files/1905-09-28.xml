                        ENGLAND’S RIGHT TO SAFEGUARD INDIA. THE EVENT OF ANOTHER RUSSO-JAPANESE
                        WAR</head>

                    <p>London, September 26. The text of the Anglo-Japanese agreement has been
                        published here and at Tokio. It con- twins a preamble uni eight articles.
                        The preamble states that the object of the agree meant is the consolidation
                        and the maintenance of general peace in Eastern Asia and India and the
                        preservation of the common interests of all the powers in China, by insuring
                        the independence and integrity of that country on the principal of the open
                        door, and the main- tenence of the territorial rights of Great Britain and
                        Japan in Eastern Asia and India, and the defence of their special interests
                        therein.</p>
                    <p>Article 1 stipulates that whenever the rights and interests of either party
                        are jeopar- dised the governments shall communicate with each other fairly,
                        and frankly consider jointly the measures to be taken to safeguard them.</p>
                    <p>Article II. provides that if by reason of an unprovoked attack or aggressive
                        action, wher- ever arising, on the part of any power or powers either party
                        be involved in war in defence of its territorial rights and interests, the
                        other party will at once come to the assist- ance of its ally, and will
                        conduct the war in common and make peace in mutual agreement.</p>
                    <p>Article III states that as Japan possesses paramount political, military, and
                        economic rights in Korea, Great Britain recognises her right to take such
                        measures for the guidance, control, and protection of Korea as she may deem
                        to be a proper and necessary safeguard to advance those interests, provided
                        that such measures do not contrary to the principle of equal commercial
                        opportunities for all.</p>
                    <p>Article IV. states that Japan recognises the rights of Great Britain to take
                        such measures in the proximity of the Indian frontier as may be necessary to
                        safeguard her Indian posses- sions.</p>
                    <p>Article V. provides tint both parties agree that neither will, without
                        consulting the other, enter into separate arrangements with another to the
                        prejudice of the objects specified in the preamble.</p>
                    <p>Article VI. refers to the event of a Russo- Japanese war, and in such case
                        Great Britain undertakes to maintain a strict neutrality, and to come to the
                        assistance of Japan in the event of attack by another power.</p>
                    <p>Article VII. stipulates that the conditions under which armed assistance will
                        be rendered shall be arranged by the Naval and Military authorities of the
                        parties, who shall consult one another freely from time to time.</p>
                    <p>Article VIII. states that the term of the present agreement is 10 years, but
                        it may be terminated by either party by a year’s notice to that effect.

                        be discounted and foreign exchange given, in fact banking business of all
                        sorts will be carried on by the branch, the establishment of which is
                        welcomed by the inhabitants of Mansourah and the neighbourhood. Mr. C. E.
                        Green will manage the now agency.</p>

                    <p>New Military Buildings in Cairo. — A confrere stated recently that the War
                        Office proposed to dispose of the military school and the barracks behind it
                        at Abbassiah and the adjoining land and with the proceeds of the sale to
                        erect now new buildings beyond tho Polygon. Tho true facts of the case are
                        that the military authorities have decided upon building a new school and
                        barracks for the infantry battalions stationed at Abbassieh, as they
                        consider the present old buildings not worth repairing, but they are
                        awaiting the necessary grant from the Ministry of Finance who will then
                        dispose of the present buildings as it deems best.</p>

                    <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and
                        mer- chants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which
                        was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this
                        country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any
                        member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the
                        question of appoint- ing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such
                        advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to
                        become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual
                        subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also
                        includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers
                        can obtain farther particulars from our London office, 36, New Broad-street,
                        which acts as agents to the Chamber.</p>

                    <p>(By Telegraph). Port Said, Thursday 8.48 a.m. Mr. Harris and his assistants
                        commenced fixing the firing charger in the holds of the Chatham at six
                        o'clock this morning and it a expect that all will be ready for the
                        explosion by nine o’clock. The "all ready’ signal, how- ever, has not yet
                        been given though it is ex- pected at any moment and excited crowds are
                        watching the offices of the Suer Canal Com- pany. The state telegraph lines
                        have not been out as it is hoped that they may escape damage. A large number
                        of special correspon- dents, representing both the Egyptian and foreign

                    <p>Thursday, 10.23 a.m. The explosion of the Chatham took place at 9.58 a.m. I
                        took up my position on the roof of the Eastern Exchange Hotel as being the
                        most suitable site, from which to view the explosion and that I might be
                        able to wire you the result without delay. I am, therefore, unable to go
                        into details but will wire you fully at the earliest possible moment.</p>
                    <p>The great event has passed successfully but I cannot say to what extent the
                        mari- time and fresh water canals have been dam- aged. The lines of the
                        State Telegraphs have been broken and messages are being sent via the cable
                        of theEastern Telegraph Company.</p>
                    <p>As for the explosion, from my position it appeared as if a vast colnmn of
                        grey smoke, shaped like a gigantic tree, was rushing up- wards with great
                        rapidity. No earth tremor was perceptible and the surface of the water in
                        the harbour and in the canal all along the stretch visible from here was not
                        disturbed in the slightest degree.</p>
                    <p>Had we not been waiting in feverish excite- ment and expecting one knew not
                        what, the explosion would have in all probability passed unnoticed. The
                        tradesmen, of the town, who had closed their shops in many instances, were
                        greatly surprised, as were indeed all those who had remained in Port Said,
                        and perhaps a little disappointed that some damage was not done to a few
                        windows.</p>

                        10 a.m. the sound of the explosion was very distictly heard at lamailia 25

                    <p>Port Said 1.36 p.m. The explosion has been a great success. The fore part of
                        the ship has been blown away as far as the fore engine room. There are now
                        twenty-two metres of water underneath the explosive magazine. The canal is
                        now only five metres deep in the middle, the average depth of water having
                        been nice metres before explosion. The charge was fired from kilometre 12 by
                        Mr. Harris. Seven observers were watching from this point, the remainder
                        waiting at kilometer 8. Fearful damage was done to the Asiatic shore, a ritt
                        50 feet long being blown in the east bunk. No damage was done to the African
                        back. The rails have not been disturbed. The Canal telegraph wires have been
                        destroy- ed. The State wires will be repaired by 3 p.m. The fresh water
                        canal is uninjured. Showers of debris fa11 in the circle of 600 yards
                        radius, Beams, rails, fragments of the engines, and plates were hurled
                        everywhere. Thousands of fish were killed. Repair gangs are on the spot It
                        is hoped that the dual will be dear in seven days.</p>

                    <p>To-day’s operations at kilometre 19 were, from all I hear, decidedly
                        interesting. Mr. Harris in company with his assistants and the chief
                        electrician of the Canal Company were to be been at the railway station at
                        an early hour making enquiries fur special materials which had been rent
                        from Alexandria. The party, after having procured some special instruments
                        for testing electric currents from the electric light station, proceeded to
                        the Canal office where Mr. Tillier held a short consulta- tion with Mr.
                        Harris, after which, he and his party proceeded in the Albatross down the
                        canal and took with them cables, wires, and a quantity of other material for
                        the tests which it was proposed to carry through to-day. The party arrived
                        at Ras el Esh where a gang was awaiting the arrival of the explosives train
                        which had attached to it a powder waggon holding twenty oases of high
                        explosives, all of exactly the same type ad is to be found in the bold of
                        the unfortunate Chatham, viz red dynamite and blasting gelatine. In the
                        waggon were also rolls of new submarine cable and a considerable quantity of
                        other necessary mater- ial for the monster explosion.</p>
                    <p>The experts then proceeded to test the wires and batteries, of which there
                        were severed, the principal being a twist exploder of the very latest type
                        with which quite a number marine detonators were fired.Test followed test;
                        long and short cables in fact every imaginable trial was made, many of a
                        most severe character, the idea being that there should not be the slightest
                        chance of any hitch occurring on Thursday. I understand that after some
                        hours of these trials of every possible combination, Mr. Harris declared
                        himself satisfied in everv way. and he is un- <cb/>doubtedly of the opinion
                        that things will go smoothly at the proper time. The power of this twist
                        exploder is stupendous, registering a number of empires such as is not
                        indicated on the newest and beat devised of voltameter- which Mr. Harris
                        used in his trials. The voltage also is large but, from what I know of the
                        matter, I believe that it is not voltage - which is of such paramount
                        importance but volume, which quality is only indicated by the number of
                        amperes a battery registers when actually delivering its electric force. The
                        detonators to be used in the explosion are of the most recent manufacture
                        and are construct- ed purely and simply for submarine work. The detonating
                        charge is enclosed within a brass tube, which in its turn is covered with
                        thick layers of guttapercha and tape. The firing shock is delivered along
                        two copper wires which terminate in the interior of the fuse in a small
                        platino-iridium bridge. The action of these fuses is simple ; the current of
                        sui- able volume being delivered along the wires from the battery heats the
                        bridge in a moment, the bridge at once glows, and, in so doing, fires the
                        charge of fulminate of mercury contained in the brass tube. This shook being
                        commun- icated to the mine in which the fuse is placed, causes the material
                        of the mine to explode. After firing quite a number of detonators the party
                        returned to the Ras el Esh station and eventually arrived at Port Said at a
                        late hour.</p>
                    <p>The explosives which arrived at kilometre 14 at about 2 p.m. were carefully
                        transported across the canal to the Asiatio bank and there covered up and
                        left properly guarded. They will remain there until to morrow, when Mr.
                        Harris proposes to prepare the mines for the great event.</p>

                    <p>The Canal Company’s steam launch was early at work again to-day taking M.
                        Tillier, the Chef da Transit, and Mr. Harris’ party down the canal, so that
                        they might make all final arrangements, and prepare the firing charges
                        before dark, for to-morrow morning. During the day the telegraph staff were-
                        busy clearing all the wires which are to be used to-morrow and n umbers of
                        men were putting the final touches to the other prepara- tions, notably
                        those connected with the fresh water canal and railway.</p>
                    <p>A considerable number of rails have been accumulated at kilometres 14 and 24
                        in readiness to proceed at once with the repairs which may be necessary
                        after the explosion, and gangs of railway men were being instruct- ed in
                        their duties so that there might be as little delay as possible when the
                        time comes for action.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harris and his staff prooceeded to the wreak early in the morning and
                        passed a final inspection, making several slight modi- fications in the
                        arrangements with a view to having things straight and clear before the
                        fixing of the mines took place.</p>
                    <p>Ten cases of explosives were handled, their contents being emptied into
                        canvas bags which were made on the spot and were afterwards sown up. There
                        are two mines; the larger one of 3001bs. of blasting gelatine and dynamite
                        is intended for the magazine of the vessel, and the smaller charge, mode np
                        in exactly the same way of 200 lbs. of similar material, is to go into No. 3
                        hold.</p>
                    <p>The wires being made and the detonator having been connected to their
                        respective charges, tea wires which are to traverse the canal from the
                        telephone cables on the west bank, were attached and the joints most care-
                        fully made. After this a length of cable equal to the distance between the
                        two holds was connected to the charges and all was declared ready.</p>
                    <p>The wires were stowed away and locked up on board a dahabesh ; the batteries
                        were ins- pected ; and the party returned to Port Said after a most tiring
                        day.</p>

                    <p>The Akraba on the port tank was unfortuna- tely caught by the Calypso on the
                        starboard tack, close to the finishing line and the Calypso pushing her
                        advantage, the Akraba had to give way. Again when the Akraba had manag- ed
                        to get away back on the port take the Masr came along on the starboard tank
                        and forced here to give way again ; this was all pretty manoeuvring riewed
                        by the spectators but was greatly to the disadvantage of the Akraba which
                        however came in third.</p>
